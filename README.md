 ## ASSIGNMENT-1     



### Simulation Exercise

In this assignment you need to investigate 5 discrete (Binomial,
geometric, Poisson, Negative Binomial, Discrete Uniform) and 5
continuous distributions (Normal, exponential, Beta, Gamma,
Lognormal) to check whether the Central Limit Theorem works for
any population distribution or not.
For example, you may simulate the exponential distribution where
lambda is the rate parameter. Expectation of exponential
distribution is reciprocal of lambda and the s.d. is same as
expectation. 


### Part One:

You should:
• Show the parameters of the distribution
• Show how the distribution looks like for different values of the
parameters using simulations.
• Show how the mean and variance changes for different
parameters.
This Exercise is to make you understand pmf and pdf well.
Moreover, all the important distributions should be hands on
simulated.


### Part Two:

Now, you may for example set lambda = 0.2 for the further analysis
and perform simulations. You will investigate the distribution of
averages of 40 exponentials (one sample containing n=40).
Perform thousand simulations to collect thousand such samples
containing 40 exponentials.
Using simulation show the properties of the distribution of the
mean of 40 exponentials. You should
• Show the expectation of the statistic sample mean and
compare it to the mean parameter of the population
distribution.
• Show the difference between variance of the sample mean
and compare it to the theoretical variance parameter of the
population distribution.
• Show that the distribution of sample mean is approximately
normal.
